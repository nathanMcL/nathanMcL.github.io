# (07/13/2025) Backend troubleshooting

Writing code can be empowering, addictive, exciting to get to test out what you created...
This might not be the best part of developing - But! Troubleshooting is essential.
I think that troubleshooting is the most challenging portion of developing software. Sometimes the error message is vague, and there are multiple errors, so you might have to resolve one just to find out what the bigger error might be.<br>

In a bad way, I like troubleshooting when ***MY DANG BACKEND SCRIPT ISN'T LOGGING***. It's almost like taking a physical fitness test, but for my brain and patients. You train mentally and physically. Once you take that fitness test, you can assess your training effectiveness. Similarly to how I think about troubleshooting, the more `types of errors` I see. The better I get. The annoying thing, typos. <br>
