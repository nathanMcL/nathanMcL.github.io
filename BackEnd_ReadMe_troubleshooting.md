# (07/13/2025) Backend troubleshooting

Writing code can be empowering, addictive, exciting to get to test out what you created...
This might not be the best part of developing - But! Troubleshooting is essential.
I think that troubleshooting is the most challenging portion of developing software. Sometimes the error message is vague, and there are multiple errors, so you might have to resolve one just to find out what the bigger error might be.<br>

In a bad way, I like troubleshooting when ***MY DANG BACKEND SCRIPT ISN'T LOGGING***. It's almost like taking a physical fitness test, but for my brain and patients. You train mentally and physically. Once you take that fitness test, you can assess your training effectiveness. Similarly to how I think about troubleshooting, the more `types of errors` I see. The better I get. The annoying thing, typos. <br>

## (07/15/2025.1350) There will be errors!

Three files that did not ***proc***, no ***crit***, all ***fizzle***. That's where I get to come in and figure out why the backend files are not getting `triggered` as scheduled.<br>

A cat's meow @ 0310 üò¥.
In the yard @ 0315 ü•±.
Meows' and pawing on glass... On a second-floor window ledge üò£.
Jumping to the first floor roof, back to the widow ledge pawing, meowing üò£üò£ ~0318...
Me climbing out of the window... softly calling the kitty... walking across the roof üòï...
Kitty running through the yard üò´ ~0326... <br>

I have been resolving my issues with my `Deployment (deploy_api.sh)`. My initial `Deployment` was and has been successful, in regards to the server file and the necessary files unzipped and functioning. 
The files, however, were being stored in a Temporary type of directory. This prevented **all** my server supporting files to not being stored in the correct root directory. Then there is Azure's `Service Plan` tier. I had to create an additional `" .deployment "` file that needed to change a setting that is offered in a higher tier than mine. So, I created a file that changed the setting. Now all **" My "** Server files have unzipped to the correct directory. I should be able to test the additional Python scripts.<br>

### `requirements_scan.py`

This `requirements_scan` Python file is fun.<br>
Using Python to `generate` and `prepare` a `Bash` script named:<br>
`check_dependencies.sh`<br>
The `check_dependencies` scans the deployed Python environment for:<br>

- Outdated packages. <br>  
- Know Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures (Using the `saftey` tool).<br>

The `requirements_scan.py` *Python* script should then produce a human-readable log.<br>

#### Shell Scripting

First define the `Shell Script` (script_content).<br>
The `script_content` Logs:<br>

- Current Timestamp: <br>
`TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`<br>

- Lists *all* outdated Python packages: <br>

```
echo "Outdated packages:" | tee -a $LOGFILE
pip list --outdated 2>&1 | tee -a $LOGFILE
```

- Checks for `CVE` vulnerabilities in the requirements.txt file, using the `saftey` tool.<br>

#### Handling Missing Tools

If `saftey` is not installed, it will auto-install it with `pip install saftey`.<br>

#### Write to a Log File

I am working on logging all results outputted to `/app/dependency_check.log` and exported to the same private `Google Drive` as `serverLog_Dump.py` but different directory name.<br>

#### Writes and Enables the Script

Then the `Python script`  saves the content.<br>

### How it Connects to the Server

Within the `startup.sh` file (the same one that is used to start the server from deployment, but with add-ons) script is code that *triggers* the initial `requirements_scan.py` to:<br>

- "Set up" the `check_dependencies.sh`. <br>
- Run a *first-time* dependency scan. <br>
- Log any issue to `/home/LogFiles/log_uploads.log`. <br>

...Next...<br>

### Schedule Weekly Checks

Within `startup.sh` there is a loop that runs in the background that automatically executes: <br>

- The dependency scan (`bash ./check_dependencies.sh`). <br>
- Upload the logs to my Google Dive using `serverLog_Dump.py`. <br>


```
python3 requirements_scan.py
```
